# travels_of_hunt
GitHub repository for the code used for analysing and mapping the expressed sentiment in Eleonora Hunt's travelogue "My Trip Around the World", first published in 1902. 

Used for the course (by me, as a student) "Digital Humanities Research Methods" as part of the Master's programme in Digital Humanities at the Linnaeus University. 

Main locations visisted during Hunt's journey around the world (time sensitive gif, where the duration of a location being visible on the map coresponds to the amount of time spent there - the longer the visibility of a location, the longer the stay):

Heatmap of the sentiment expressed towards each main location (the bigger and darker the dot - the more positive the sentiment is):
