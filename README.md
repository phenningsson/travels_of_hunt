# travels_of_hunt
GitHub repository for the code used for analysing and mapping the expressed sentiment in Eleonora Hunt's travelogue "My Trip Around the World" published in 1912. 

Used for the course (by me, as a student) "Digital Humanities Research Methods" as part of the Master's programme in Digital Humanities at the Linnaeus University.
