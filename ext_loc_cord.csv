Chicago,Chicago,"His manner toward us was most cordial and especially towards the
one of our group who hailed from Chicago. He spoke through an
interpreter, saying that the governor of Chicago had called on him
before the World's Fair, urging the holy man to visit him at the time of
the exhibition, but he could not think of ever leaving India. He then
sent for his book of registration and showed us the name registered as
Carter H. Harrison.",41.8755616,-87.6244212

profound Hindoo scholar, and without doubt will be canonized after
death. His manner toward us was most cordial and especially towards the

dense, and it has been truly said that nowhere else than in Shephard's
Hotel can such a transformation scene be witnessed. Many of my own
neighbors from Chicago were here. We met our Japanese colonel again.",41.8755616,-87.6244212
Chicago,Chicago,"Port Said is said to be the most wicked place
on earth. As I hailed from Chicago I thought perhaps honors were even. We did not go ashore, but got our steamer chairs in readiness for the
next day, as we were told we would have a choppy sea, and we fully
realized the truth of the prophecy.",41.8755616,-87.6244212
Chicago,Chicago,"A hasty breakfast and a few good-byes are spoken, and my heart swells
within me, as I spring from the gang-plank to the shore, and the lines

    ""My native country, thee,
    Land of the noble free,
      Thy name I love;
    I love thy rocks and rills,
    Thy woods and templed hills,
    My heart with rapture thrills
      Like that above,""

seem to express all and more than all that I could say. A short stay of a few hours in New York, and an uneventful trip on the
New York Central Railroad brought me into Chicago, where those nearest
and dearest to me were in waiting to bid me welcome home. And now in
closing, my dear children, I will say: ""That if the work I have done in
leaving you these impressions and footprints, gives the pleasure hoped
for, I will feel compensated, notwithstanding I have labored when the
flesh was weak and my vision clouded.",41.8755616,-87.6244212

influence, and when that desire or wish was gratified and that day dream
became a reality to feel an overwhelming sadness--a heart failure? If
so, you can realize how on August 19, 1895, at 6:30 p. m., I left
Chicago with a heavy heart for a voyage around the world in company with
my brother, his wife and son, the latter just relieved from college
life. We arrived in St. Paul in time for breakfast, the train already made
up that was to convey us on the Canadian Pacific Railroad to Vancouver,

Minnesota and villages few and far between.",41.8755616,-87.6244212

Glaciers,Glaciers,"The scenery from the Glacier House to Vancouver, through the Selkirk
Mountains is overpowering; around countless curves, over lofty trestles
and ragged edges of fearful precipices the line of cars pursues its way. The stupendous heights are at times absolutely shrouded in smoke; the
climb of twenty-seven hundred feet in thirty miles around the mountain
shelves and through vast snow sheds (most expensive in their
construction), to emerge again into the light for a glance down the
gorges into the glaciers, over and above to the lofty summits, is all
the imagination can picture, and the traveler feels like a ""mighty atom""
in the midst thereof. On the fifth day out from home we arrived in the city of Vancouver.",51.3043,-117.5194
Glaciers,Glaciers,"Now and then, their bones were seen in white patches on the
prairies, and at the stations tons were ready for shipment east to make
tooth-brush handles and bone dust for soda fountains, etc. We had been
advised to stop at the Glaciers instead of Banff, perhaps by some
traveler who felt the inconvenience of getting up at three o'clock in
the morning to take the train. We regretted it, however, when we were
told that the hotel is nestled among the mountains rising over 5,000
feet above it, all of them snow capped and far down the sides of the
deep gorges was still seen the same white vestment.",51.3043,-117.5194
Glaciers,Glaciers,"A few Indians visit the station on the arrival of
trains; some to barter, others--blind or crippled--to beg. The third day
out, at 1:30 p. m., we reached the Glaciers, where we remained
twenty-four hours. Through Assinniboin, north of western Dakota, we had
noticed deep furrowed trails of the buffalo crossing the road from north
to south.",51.3043,-117.5194
Vancouver,Vancouver,"The constant fear of encountering a
wolf or bear, together with the sight of the great mountain of ice, soon
cools one's ardor, and we were content to retrace our steps and to
gather after dinner around an old-fashioned stove in the exchange of the
Inn with a score of travelers and listen to the stories of their
adventures and have for an object lesson skins of the grizzlies but
lately captured, which had not a soporific effect, but less terrific
than meeting their majesties face to face. The scenery from the Glacier House to Vancouver, through the Selkirk
Mountains is overpowering; around countless curves, over lofty trestles

of the Dakotas, with no signs of vegetation along the railway, and but
little animal life.",49.2608724,-123.113952
Vancouver,Vancouver,"I had
no room mate, much to my joy. This was my ""mascot"" from the time I
boarded the steamer at Vancouver--with but one exception, and that was
on the steamer ""Pekin"" from Columbo to Calcutta where I had a dear old
lady from Australia (Mrs. Champion) share my cabin. We had seventy
first-class passengers.",49.2608724,-123.113952
Yokohama,Yokohama,"Mrs. Ashmore, as Mrs. Brown, was the
founder of the ""Mary Colby Seminary"" at Yokohama, afterwards removing to
China with her second husband. One of her daughters married Mr. Curtis,

Yokohama,Yokohama,"The
view from the tea house overlooking the sea is most charming. There our
guide has laid for us a tempting lunch brought from the hotel at
Yokohama. Tea and service is offered us by most graceful Japanese
waitresses, who have no hesitation in assisting our gentlemen change
their clothing for the bathing suit, that they may follow them to the
water's edge to see them sport like fish in the bright blue waters, and
were it not for the pestiferous fleas, one might declare the excursion
perfect.",35.4443947,139.6367727
Yokohama,Yokohama,"For centuries
the cultured class of patrons of the temples have given these people
work, for every rich temple adds to its wealth bronzes, lacquered work,
vestments of brocades, tapestries and carvings of images, each having
its fire-proof building in which its treasures are kept; they are not
seen in the temples. As for the missionary work, we visited the ""Mary
Colby Seminary,"" a boarding and day school in Yokohama, Miss Grafton of
Vermont being principal. At that time there were fifty native children
as scholars, most of them able to pay for their own tuition.",35.4443947,139.6367727
Yokohama,Yokohama,"We were in sight of land, but instead of
reaching it at seven-thirty in the evening we did not accomplish it
until 10 o'clock Monday morning. The steamer ""Belgic"" was stranded that
night forty-three miles from Yokohama. The captain, who had for forty
years made successful trips, was destined to see his vessel wrecked; no
lives were lost but the rebuke he received cost him the loss of his
position--and much greater the loss of reason.",35.4443947,139.6367727
Yokohama,Yokohama,"Each city of Japan seems to have its specialty; for
instance: We found the handsomest kimonas, the finest cloisonais in
Yokohama: the best carving in ivory in Tokio. As for a gentleman's outfit it would be advisable to go to Yokohama with
an empty trunk, for good materials and perfect fit are guaranteed for
marvelously low prices. There your duck suits, Pongees and silk
underwear for the tropics are laid in with great satisfaction.",35.4443947,139.6367727
Yokohama,Yokohama,"The Bungalow of the native all exposed to
view is a sample of neatness, while the children, most gentle with each
other, play in numbers around the home. On this drive and but a short distance from Yokohama is the English
concession, homes hidden almost from view by high walls and dense
foliage. In that land of sunshine, with the cool breeze from the sea,
the constant influx of European and American travelers, keeping one in
touch with the world and with the simplicity of the surroundings, one
can imagine a tranquilizing life and a happy coterie.",35.4443947,139.6367727

Yokohama,Yokohama,"Nevertheless, a guide is
indispensable to protect against intrusive curiosity, for wherever you
stop, there the gaping crowd surrounds you. The shopping fever seems to manifest itself almost immediately on
arrival at Yokohama; in fact, I heard of no epidemic so fatal to
visitors. Your guide, who has an eye to the commission he will receive
on all your purchases, gives you his advice as to where you shall
buy--to his best advantage.",35.4443947,139.6367727
Yokohama,Yokohama,"The ship was
well disciplined, the table inviting, the service entirely
Chinese--whose sense of decorum was most marked. On Sunday evening, the thirteenth day out, we expected to anchor at
Yokohama, but a fearful wind arose; the captain left his seat at the
dinner table in haste and ordered the ship's course changed. We were
skirting a terrific typhoon.",35.4443947,139.6367727
Yokohama,Yokohama,"In that land of sunshine, with the cool breeze from the sea,
the constant influx of European and American travelers, keeping one in
touch with the world and with the simplicity of the surroundings, one
can imagine a tranquilizing life and a happy coterie. The streets of Yokohama are narrow, the houses of one, sometimes two
stories, all on line with the sidewalk and with apparently no privacy. The gutters are flushed with water, which seems to be used for all
purposes, even to the bathing of children.",35.4443947,139.6367727
Niko,Niko,"Near by and in the same enclosure is the sacred
horse, a stupid looking animal, guarded by an old woman, who for a
trifling recompense will feed it a few beans from a small saucer. From Niko we go to Tokio, a city of magnificent distances, the home of
the Mikado. We stop at the Imperial Hotel, the best kept in Japan.",36.7197576,139.698139
Niko,Niko,"A missionary told me that they
endeavored early to marry the converted man to the Christian woman and
to insist that they should sit together at their meals, but it was a
hard lesson and seldom adopted. The temples of Niko surpass all others that we saw in Japan. Broad
avenues, well shaded, lead up to the hills upon which they were built.",36.7197576,139.698139
Niko,Niko,"There we barter all evening with natives for
furs of the monkey, idols of ivory and objects of interest of wood and
bronze. The trip to Lake Chuzendi, eight miles from Niko, is made by
chairs and jinrikishas carried and drawn by the coolies. For our party
of four we take two chairs and three jinrikishas and seventeen
coolies--four for each chair, two to pull and one to push the
jinrikishas.",36.7197576,139.698139
Niko,Niko,"The day's journey is made all the more agreeable by the luncheon of
quail sandwiches, fruits and hot tea, the latter made by our guide in
our compartment. At five-thirty o'clock in the evening we arrive at the
Hotel Niko, the weather cold and rainy, a poor table and damp,
uninviting apartments. A brazier is at the solicitation of the guests
placed in the drawing room.",36.7197576,139.698139

water's edge to see them sport like fish in the bright blue waters, and
were it not for the pestiferous fleas, one might declare the excursion
perfect. The journey to Niko by rail is most diversified, shaded for miles by the
Cryptomeria trees. The pear tree, trellised with its luscious fruit
somewhat like our Russet apple or a taste akin to watermelon, is seen.",36.7197576,139.698139
Tokio,Tokio,"The ponderous bells, struck by
great beams of wood swung from the outside, give forth mighty mysterious
murmurings. The population of the city of Tokio is a million and a half (1895) and
covers a territory as large as London. The castle of the Mikado, in the
center of the city, occupies a space of several miles in circumference.",35.6768601,139.7638947
Tokio,Tokio,"The inhabitants go
bareheaded, carrying umbrellas. The convenience of the river that runs
through Tokio and the canals that intersperse its streets is very
apparent. Public education is compulsory.",35.6768601,139.7638947

Nagasaki,Nagasaki,"We reached this point at 12:00
p. m. Before arriving a late supper was ordered by a few to celebrate
the leave-taking, for many who had traveled together so far were to
continue their journey to Marseilles and from thence to England, and
others with us were to go into Egypt. We here bade good-bye to Mr. and
Miss Donnesthorpe, who had been with us en route from Nagasaki, Japan. Before leaving Mr. Donnesthorpe gave me his confidence regarding his
engagement to an English girl he had left at home.",33.1154683,129.7874339
Nagasaki,Nagasaki,"The sky cloudless, temperature about 72 (Oct. 1st,

fine. War vessels from almost every country lie at anchor in the
sparkling waters.",33.1154683,129.7874339
Shanghai,Shanghai,"Their eagerness for success is most noticeable, and they are
rewarded after having satisfied their owner, by being given some of the
small fry. Our steamer anchored fifteen miles off of Shanghai, and our
heavily freighted tender was two hours reaching land. The harbor was
filled with bright colored sailing vessels, junks and sampans,
stern-wheel kickaway and chop boats; also the bateaux of the ""Tanka""
girls who work the ferries.",31.2312707,121.4700152
Shanghai,Shanghai,"He was taken to Paris where, under
Charcot's care, he recovered sufficiently to return to Cambridge, Mass.,
where his work was completed ready for publication. This he desired to
have done in Shanghai. We were told his translation would excel all
others that have ever been made.",31.2312707,121.4700152
Hongkong,Hongkong,"Jugglers throng the piazzas of the hotel, and for a trifling
compensation will swallow a sword three feet long which he flaunts
before our eyes and which disappears to all appearances down his throat
with great strangling; this we do not ask him to repeat. A charming sail of three days brought us into the harbor of Hongkong. The city is built on the mountainside; a narrow strip along the water's
edge is laid out in a fine driveway, warehouses, hotels and club houses
facing the water.",22.350627,114.1849161
Hongkong,Hongkong,"The enjoyment of this scene quite repays
one for the undertaking. Queen's road (the principal street of Hongkong)
runs parallel with the water; from this street, running toward the
mountain, the grade is uphill. We ascend stone steps, twenty to thirty
in number, to reach the street beyond; consequently we do not frequent
them often.",22.350627,114.1849161
Hongkong,Hongkong,"His family were feeling the effect of their
protracted sojourn here and yearned for a change. The distance from Hongkong to Canton is ninety-five miles by the river. We were somewhat surprised to find the captain of our vessel from
Prairie du Chien, Wis., whose family was still residing there.",22.350627,114.1849161
Hongkong,Hongkong,"The Sikh soldiers are the handsomest known. We see them acting as
policemen at Hongkong, and we stop to admire their erect carriage and
military tread. There is one defect, however, in the anatomy of the men
of India; they have no calves to their legs.",22.350627,114.1849161
Hongkong,Hongkong,"We afterward met him at Cairo. Two days out from Hongkong
(Oct. 19, 1895) we skirted the Island of Hainan, which is separated from
the mainland of China by the Gulf of Tonquin, and passing the Empire of
Anan we enter the St. James River, eight degrees north of the
equator--Far. 83.",22.350627,114.1849161
Hongkong,Hongkong,"A snug, cool
cabin all to myself, which opened into a private hallway with a great
open hatchway, or open half-door, gave me the delicious sea air in its
fulness of life and vigor without the necessity of my going on deck. Our
steamer chairs bought at Hongkong were shipped through from Ismalia on
the same vessel we were sailing to Albert Docks, London, where I found
mine in good condition. I could recline in this private hall, book in
hand, and cull from its valuable contents, information of the objects I
had seen, and what was still in store for me--all the Oriental steamers
have well-chosen libraries for the benefit of travelers.",22.350627,114.1849161
Hongkong,Hongkong,"The
markets are disgusting with the skinned rats and bloody fish which are
offered for sale, and a few days' sojourn amidst such surroundings
satisfies the traveler. On our return to Hongkong (the port from which we sailed) the sight of
the French steamer ""Melbourne,"" which was to bear us on our journey, was
an agreeable vision, although on that line of steamers little is done
for the pleasure of the passengers. We took on at Saigon the Governor of
Siberia, his wife and secretary; also the Siberian Minister to China,
with his wife, with many Russians.",22.350627,114.1849161
Canton,Canton,"We saw a head which had been decapitated before our arrival. From the
wall of Canton we could see mountainsides, which seemed to be one vast
number of graves, whose entrance were in the form of a horseshoe. In the
city is a building they call the ""Old Man's Paradise.""",23.1301964,113.2592945
Canton,Canton,"If it were not for
the novel sights that meet the eye the sympathy aroused would be too
trying for the traveler. Canton is called the ""City of Rams,"" or the
""City of the Genii."" These names are derived from the supposed visit of
fire-protecting spirits that came from heaven two thousand years ago.",23.1301964,113.2592945
Canton,Canton,"Whampun and Homan, two lofty pagodas, made
famous by their age and height, are seen from the steamer, and an
occasional dead body of a Chinaman floats by us. As we near the landing
of Canton small boats filled with lepers come alongside soliciting alms. They are most pitiful in appearance and, judging from the coins thrown
them, it is the only means of their maintenance.",23.1301964,113.2592945

Canton,Canton,"It
has now its European concession. Canton is a typical Chinese city, the
contracted streets, not exceeding six feet in width except in spaces
where some official residence or temple is built. It is with great
difficulty we make any headway through these narrow lanes, and are often
compelled to leave our chairs and with our guide pursue our way on foot.",23.1301964,113.2592945
Canton,Canton,"Later
the East India Company took possession and for a century and a half
controlled the foreign trade. The British invaded the city of Canton in
1841 and took possession, but the ransom of six million was made for its
redemption. Again in 1857 the allied forces of British and French
captured it, and for nearly four years it was in the hands of
foreigners, its government being administered by a joint commission.",23.1301964,113.2592945
Canton,Canton,"The place was
rather attractive than otherwise. We lunched upon the walls of Canton in
a deserted building, but old with memories. We visited some shops where
the crepe, for which the manufactory is noted, can be found in almost
all colors, some beautifully embroidered, for moderate prices.",23.1301964,113.2592945
Saigon,Saigon,"On our return to Hongkong (the port from which we sailed) the sight of

Siberia, his wife and secretary; also the Siberian Minister to China,
with his wife, with many Russians. The ladies of the party were
handsome, and often regaled us with their beautiful voices.",10.7763897,106.7011391
Saigon,Saigon,"Convoys of storks, plumed golden pheasants, the Coachin China chickens,
cages of monkeys, leopards and bears all amuse and entertain the
traveler. Saigon is a French concession and has at least 100,000
inhabitants. Late in the afternoon the Governor General of Coachin China
boarded the vessel with his son.",10.7763897,106.7011391
Saigon,Saigon,"The dress of the Coachin-Chinamen consists of long, loose
flowing trousers, with a black or white robe falling from the shoulders,
and a red or white turban on their heads. The heat at Saigon in October
was oppressive, and we were advised to keep aboard the vessel till late
in the evening. Our ride to the botanical gardens over smooth roads of
red clay in the jinrikisha, with a bright turbaned coolie, was most
picturesque amid the perfection of tropical growth of plants and trees.",10.7763897,106.7011391
Singapore,Singapore,"This is performed mostly by
women with a weird chant of ""heave ho"" that seems to render the task
less irksome. Singapore was purchased by the British. It is the greatest tin producing
country in the world.",1.357107,103.8194992
Singapore,Singapore,"A smooth sea and fair breeze made the next two days and a half fairly
enjoyable, but the heat was overpowering at times; the nights were spent
by many on deck, where the firmament could be enjoyed, as the Southern
Cross was seen in its great beauty. Singapore, the next stopping place,
afforded us a fine drive in a chariot through the country. These
vehicles seat comfortably four persons, a charioteer, who drove, and an
outrider seated behind.",1.357107,103.8194992
Kandy,Kandy,"If you
decide not to purchase them but to call again, woe be to you if you do
not keep your word, as you are followed and the cry of ""Lady, come back,
you promised!"" becomes a trifle wearisome. To visit Kandy, situated eighteen hundred feet above the sea, in the
mountains of the interior of Ceylon, we take passage on a railroad of
marvelous engineering. To quote a traveler's words may give you some
idea of the beauty of the views obtained: ""As one skirts the flanks of
the mountains and looks down into an enormous gorge, its sides clad with
the most beautiful and varied foliage of flowers and trees, and on the
level bottom lands can be seen cascades, which are formed by the
artificial lakes that overflow the exquisitely delicate green of the
young rice.""",7.2931208,80.6350358

Kandy,Kandy,"Roundabout
this region live the tea planters with their families. Kandy is a

attractiveness.",7.2931208,80.6350358
Kandy,Kandy,"The palace

in length and a yard wide, meets us along the way, urging us to buy--a
temptation we cannot resist, although we wonder what we shall do with
them when we get them. But adieux must be made to Ceylon, with its spicy
breezes, for the ""Steamer Pekin"" lies at anchor off Colombo which is to
bear us over 1,300 miles to Calcutta, the voyage only broken by a short

speedy return for one or many more wild boar or tiger hunts amid the
jungles, where they may add to their already large stock of skins. We
found the best stock of these for sale in Calcutta in a famous house on
the opposite side of the street from the Grand Hotel. It is essential to
select a tiger skin with perfect claws and natural teeth, as too often
artificial ones are used to promote a sale, and to have them perfect in
their curing is most desirable; if not, your trunk in which they are
packed will be well filled with vermin.",22.5726459,88.3638953

at the present time the rarest and most costly have been sent to some
Maha Rajah who makes regal purchases, and those he declines, perhaps
from his sufficiency, are returned for sale to those whose love for gems
is weighed in a balance with their purse. An English lady artist who was solicited to paint the portrait of one of
these Rajahs in his own palace, and to abide in the premises during her
time of labor, told me her powers of description failed her in the
attempt to portray to others what the coffers of these rulers of
provinces contained, and with which they adorned themselves on state
occasions, and to convey to canvas their beauties, would have been the

themselves: all baggage is ordered from the cabins on deck, even to the
smallest hand-bag; search is made for fire arms: strict laws regarding
them are enforced, and if you are unfortunate enough to have one in your
possession, as was one of our party, you are quickly relieved of it, and

make ourselves lucid, from Bombay to Calcutta--but to keep the matter
secret from us so that we might give them a return ticket, which they

reach Ismalia, Saturday, December 21, at 12:30 p. m., what blissful

places, if possible, where we were subjected to jeers and penetrating
glances into our carriage by the passers-by.",51.5074456,-0.1277653
London,London,"Two carriages were provided
for the party, and each held besides four occupants, a seat either for
Mr. Burr or his son, with the respective coachmen. We drove to the
station and then took the steam cars to ""Wandsworth,"" a short distance
from London. On disembarking we walked to one of the public resorts
known as a ""Coffee House,"" where light refreshments, with tea, coffee
and chocolate are offered at a trifling price; also a bottled drink
labelled Ozone, which had no intoxicating influence.",51.5074456,-0.1277653
London,London,"Mrs.
Mary Livermore, of Massachusetts, was in this category. She had been
sent over by her state or the city of Boston, to investigate the ""Coffee
Houses"" of London, and Mr. Burr was known as a philanthropist in that
city. Preparations were made to see London by gas light, and I was among
the few invited to go with Mrs. Livermore.",51.5074456,-0.1277653
London,London,"However, we felt ourselves most favored at this extraordinary
opportunity of witnessing the gentle manners, and hearing the musical
intonation of voice that marks good birth. On Sunday afternoon we went in search, in the east end of London, for
the ""Palace of Delight,"" and its surroundings. We took the tramway and
inquired of a demure, missionary-looking lady, the way to the most
degraded quarters.",51.5074456,-0.1277653
London,London,"While wandering in the vicinity of Albert Hall, we were
attracted by crowds of people gathering roundabout its doors. On inquiry
we learned a bazaar was in progress therein for the benefit of some
London hospital. By paying the admittance fee of one pound each ($5.00)
we could enter, where we could see royalty, each person of note in his
or her booth with the name attached.",51.5074456,-0.1277653
London,London,"And mighty Neptune did
not call on us for many returns of the day. We proceed from Charing
Cross station to the hotel of the same name, where we remain until we
obtain more pleasant surroundings in the west end of London. Daily
excursions, always on top of omnibuses, when there were seats for us,
run to the Picadilly, Pall Mall, down Regent and Oxford streets and into
Dickens' haunts, when time afforded, out to St. John's Woods, and
without fail to Kensington, to the Museum, which is most absorbing of
time and interest.",51.5074456,-0.1277653
London,London,"A snug, cool
cabin all to myself, which opened into a private hallway with a great
open hatchway, or open half-door, gave me the delicious sea air in its
fulness of life and vigor without the necessity of my going on deck. Our
steamer chairs bought at Hongkong were shipped through from Ismalia on
the same vessel we were sailing to Albert Docks, London, where I found
mine in good condition. I could recline in this private hall, book in
hand, and cull from its valuable contents, information of the objects I
had seen, and what was still in store for me--all the Oriental steamers
have well-chosen libraries for the benefit of travelers.",51.5074456,-0.1277653
London,London,"We must not fail to speak of
pleasant acquaintances made; of Sir Richard and Lady Campbell, who will
be our companions en voyage when we leave this port of Bombay until we
shall say good bye to them, and Mr. and Miss ----, of England, of whom
I have before written. We ship all trunks, save our steamer, to Albert
Docks, London, where we hope to reclaim them before re-embarking for
home. The parting of retired army officers, their wives and daughters,
from the sons and brothers who are left behind to achieve fame perhaps,
or lose their lives in the farther service to their country, seemed less
affecting than I imagined such scenes would be, but we find patriotism
very pronounced among the British subjects.",51.5074456,-0.1277653
London,London,"The ponderous bells, struck by
great beams of wood swung from the outside, give forth mighty mysterious
murmurings. The population of the city of Tokio is a million and a half (1895) and
covers a territory as large as London. The castle of the Mikado, in the
center of the city, occupies a space of several miles in circumference.",51.5074456,-0.1277653

New York,New York,"To see
the bees so thickly settled there was of little satisfaction, but what
were we there for if not to touch, taste and handle? The climatic
effects will preserve this wonderful monument for ages, while their
consorts on the Thames and in New York Central Park already show signs
of decay. The ostrich farm was a more enlivening scene.",40.7127281,-74.0060152
New York,New York,"A hasty breakfast and a few good-byes are spoken, and my heart swells
within me, as I spring from the gang-plank to the shore, and the lines

    ""My native country, thee,
    Land of the noble free,
      Thy name I love;
    I love thy rocks and rills,
    Thy woods and templed hills,
    My heart with rapture thrills
      Like that above,""

seem to express all and more than all that I could say. A short stay of a few hours in New York, and an uneventful trip on the
New York Central Railroad brought me into Chicago, where those nearest
and dearest to me were in waiting to bid me welcome home. And now in
closing, my dear children, I will say: ""That if the work I have done in
leaving you these impressions and footprints, gives the pleasure hoped
for, I will feel compensated, notwithstanding I have labored when the
flesh was weak and my vision clouded.",40.7127281,-74.0060152
